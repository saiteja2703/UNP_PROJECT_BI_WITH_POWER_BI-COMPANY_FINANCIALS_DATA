# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI-COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA
I have successfully completed my project, Company Financials Dashboard, in collaboration with UNP, using Power BI to analyze financial performance and enhance data-driven decision-making. This project involved data collection, transformation, and visualization, allowing for a detailed analysis of key financial metrics such as revenue trends, profitability, cost structures, and financial ratios. The insights uncovered seasonal revenue patterns, high-profit regions, and cost optimization opportunities, helping businesses refine their financial strategies. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s interactive dashboards and data modeling capabilities, this project provides actionable insights to improve financial planning, optimize profitability, and drive business growth.
